### Study from Deep lizard - lecture: Machine learning & deep learning fundamentals

1. Machine learning: learn from data 
2. Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning that uses algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain's neural networks.

### Artificial Neural Networks(ANNs)
* ANNs are builts using what we call neurons.
* Neurons in an ANN are organized into what we call layers
* Layers within an ANN(all but the input and output layers) are called hidden layer.
* If an ANN has more than one hidden layer, the ANN is said to be a deep ANN.

In summary, deep learning uses ANNs that have multiple hidden layer.

3. An artificial neural network is a computing system that is comprised of a collection of connected units called neurons that are organized into what we call layers.

Nodes are organized into what we call layers.
At the highest level, there are three types of layers in every ANN:
* Input layer
* Hidden layer
* Output layer

Different layers perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs.
Data flows through the network starting at the input layer and moving through the hidden layers until the output layer is reached.
This is known as a forward pass through the network.
Layers positioned between the input and output layers are know as hidden layer. 

In keras, we can build what we called a sequential model. Keras defines a sequential model as a sequential stack of linear layers. 

```c
from keras.models import Sequential 
from keras.layers import Dense, Activation

layers =[
  Dense(units=3, input_shape=(2, ), activation ='relu'),
  Dense(units=2, activation = 'softmax')
]

model = Sequential(layers)
```
