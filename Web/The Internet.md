### The Internet ?
- A global network of networks. It's just a bunch of connected computers
- The Internet uses something called routing, where there are physical devices
- The way that individual machines are identified is through *IP addresses*
- The Internet is the infrastructure that carries things like Email, The web, File sharing, Online gaming, Streaming services
(To summarize, the Internet is a global network of networks, just tons and tons of different devices that are able to communicate in the Internet's really the infrastructure 
that makes it all possible)
- So, The Internet ? Global network of interconnected computers that communicate via TCP/IP network of networks

### The Web ?
- The Word Wide Web is an information system where documents and others resources are available over the Internet
- Documents are transferred via HTTP 

### HTTP request ?
- Foundation of communication on the World Wide Web
- "Hyper Text Transfer Protocol"
- *Request* -> "I would like this information please"
- *Response* -> "Ok, here you go!"

### Web Server ?
- A computer that can satisfy requests on the Web
- "server" is also used to refer to the software running on the computer

### Client ?
- The computer that accesses a server

## How it works ?
(1) Request! - Client: "Google.com/search?Q=CHICKENS"
(2) Response ! - Server: it responds back with HTML, CSS, and Javascript codes
(3) Browser: The browser takes that and turns it into this web page(display to render contents for me)

### Frontend vs Backend
- Frontend: The part of a website that the user interacts with directly is termed the front end. 
It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application. It includes everything that users experience directly: 
text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, colors, and navigation menu. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the languages used for Front End development. 
The structure, design, behavior, and content of everything seen on browser screens when websites, web applications, or mobile apps are opened up,
is implemented by front End developers. Responsiveness and performance are two main objectives of the Front End.
The developer must ensure that the site is responsive i.e. it appears correctly on devices of all sizes no part of the website should behave abnormally 
irrespective of the size of the screen. 

- Backend: Backend is the server-side of the website. It stores and arranges data, and also makes sure everything on the client-side of the website works fine. 
It is the part of the website that you cannot see and interact with. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. 
The parts and characteristics developed by backend designers are indirectly accessed by users through a front-end application.
Activities, like writing APIs, creating libraries, and working with system components without user interfaces or even systems of scientific programming, 
are also included in the backend


### CSS VS HTML VS JS
Those three technologies are responsible for making web pages are the only thing that your browser understands or the only three languages are not really all programming
languages, but they are the only technologies that our browser expects web pages to utilize and they each have a different responsibility

- CSS : adjectives(describing HTML elements)
- HTML: nouns
- JavaScript: verbs
